            <h2>Services</h2>
            <p>
            [COMPANY] professionals will provide services to you and your child using a secure video conferencing
              platform (Google Meet/Microsoft Teams/Zoom) and other communication and electronic tools. Teletherapy
              services occur in real time during a scheduled, predetermined appointment.
            </p>
            <p>
              Clinical records are the live teletherapy sessions, video/audio of the session, and written reports, that
              are produced during the provision of our services.
            </p>
            <p>
              Be advised that we will keep your digital files for a 6 months period once intervention is completed. This
              allows you to contact us in this specific time frame to attain a copy of any document relevant to your
              file. Once the designated time has lapsed, your file will be permanently deleted. It is always best if you
              keep copies of your documents and place them in a safe place.

            <h3>Confidentiality Agreement for psycho-social intervention and counseling:</h3>
            <p>
              Prior to beginning our counseling sessions, it is important for you to understand our approach to child
              and adolescent counseling and agree to some rules about your child's confidentiality during the course of
              his/her intervention.
            </p>
            <p>
              Counseling is most effective when a trusting relationship exists between the therapist and the client.
              Privacy is especially important in securing and maintaining that trust. One goal of treatment is to
              promote a stronger and better relationship between children and their parents. However, it is often
              necessary for children to develop a "zone of privacy" whereby they feel free to discuss personal matters
              with greater freedom. This is particularly true for adolescents who are naturally developing a greater
              sense of independence and autonomy, but also for younger children. By signing this agreement, you will be
              waiving any right of access to your adolescent's treatment records without their consent.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is our policy to provide you with general information about intervention status. We will not share with
              you what your child has disclosed to us without your child's consent. At the end of your child's
              counseling journey, we will provide you with feedback that will describe what issues were discussed, what
              progress was made, and what areas are likely to require intervention in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
              If your child is an adolescent, it is possible that he/she will reveal sensitive information regarding
              problematic behaviors. This agreement will only be waivered, if we believe that your child is at serious
              risk of harming him/herself, harming others or having suicidal ideations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Any use of recording devices by participants for any purpose whatsoever during children's sessions is
              strictly prohibited.
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>I will, under no circumstance, for any purpose, bring into a session any recording devices.</li>
              <li>
                I will respect the confidentiality of my child(ren)'s therapeutic sessions and will not request that
                those confidences be revealed to me.
              </li>
              <li>
                I will, under no circumstances, request that the clinician or anyone associated with [COMPANY], staff
                member or administrator, repeat, reveal or testify to any information disclosed in the sessions or
                client record.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Session Protocol</h2>
            <p>
              To benefit to the maximum extent possible from the sessions, it is obligatory to respect session
              protocols.
            </p>
            <p>For younger children, parents need to make sure of the following:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The child's readiness before starting the session (toileting, eating, restingâ€¦etc)</li>
              <li>The setting in which the session is taking place needs to be calm and away from distractions.</li>
              <li>The environment in which the session is taking place needs to be safe for the child's age.</li>
              <li>The device being used for the session: screen, laptop, phone is not within the child's reach.</li>
              <li>All materials required for the session are pre prepared.</li>
              <li>The child should not be left unattended at all times during the session.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              If for any reason, the child engages in a behavior which may cause harm to him/herself or damage to the
              surroundings in any way, under no circumstance will [COMPANY] be held responsible or liable.
            </p>
